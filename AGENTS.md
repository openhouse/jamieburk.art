# AGENTS.md - jamieburk.art

## Mission

Build and maintain a focused, public-safe portfolio that makes Jamie legible as a
Technical Project Manager - Product Operations & Implementation lead who creates
operating structure for complex public-facing teams.

## Current Canonical App

Use `apps/www`. Do not rename it to `apps/site`, `apps/web`, or another path
without explicit approval.

## Stack

Next.js App Router, React, TypeScript, MDX, Tailwind CSS, daisyUI, Node 26, npm
workspaces, Dockerfile, Dokku.

## Public-Safety Rules

Do not publish private emails, raw transcripts, private coalition notes,
legal-review materials, health/financial details, private correspondence,
unapproved photos, private fonts, credentials, private stakeholder lists,
internal analytics, client-private materials, or raw community records.

Use public-safe summaries, redacted examples, representative diagrams, approved
artifacts, and careful collective-work language.

When uncertain, write: `TODO: Jamie approval required.`

## Knowledge Bank

Use `docs/knowledge-bank/` and `apps/www/src/data/proofs.ts` as the
public-safe claim layer.

Citational claims use `apps/www/src/data/knowledge-bank/records.ts` as their
canonical machine-readable source. Do not add or strengthen a public factual
claim without updating the canonical claim, evidence relationship, and source
records.

Use `<Claim>` for high-risk canonical wording and `<Cite>` for supported
authored prose. Do not type citation numbers manually.

Do not expose private source paths, private assets, protected locators, signed
URLs, or raw research artifacts. Regenerate the redacted public registry after
changing canonical records.

Website copy should project from the knowledge bank and stay optimized for
clarity, audience, and purpose.

Do not strengthen a claim in a public page unless the stronger claim exists in
the bank with source basis, status, guardrail, and public-use boundary.

Every structured claim needs status, support level, evidence class, public
wording, guardrail, protected boundaries, and last-reviewed date.

The website should read as a composed portfolio, not a claims database.

Do not add `/proofs`, `/knowledge-bank`, or `/public-claims` public routes.

Use `docs/knowledge-bank/framework.md` as the canonical lifecycle explanation.
Agency relations classify every proof record but do not create claims. The
composition manifest governs route purpose and claim budgets but does not
approve publication. Intake, photo leads, collaborator corrections, and reader
feedback must re-enter through review; no command promotes them automatically.

Keep the 27 portfolio evals frozen when running the separate composite
integration suite. The optimizing agent may not grade its own patch. AI judges
may support code review but may not approve human reader response, rights,
consent, hands-on launch QA, production cutover, or indexing.

## Chad Lens

Minimize the reader's burden. Make Jamie visible as the actor, explain what the
work made usable, translate specialized language for hiring and public-sector
readers, and use collective-work language where the work was collective.

## Scope Rules

Do not add a CMS, database, auth, search, analytics, AI chatbot, archive browser,
private document browser, full photo archive, heavy animation, or major framework
change for V1.

## Deployment

Staging first: `staging.jamieburk.art`, noindex.
Production later: `jamieburk.art`, indexable only after Jamie approves content.

## Voice

Precise, warm, modular, ethically grounded. Documentation is care. Do not
overclaim.
